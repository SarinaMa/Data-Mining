# Data-Mining-Used Car Market Analysis
Nowadays, second-hand car has become more and more popular in the market. Customers always have to spend a lot of time and money doing research about the used car market, compare different cars and find the most reasonable price.

We are trying to help car sellers sell their car in the desired way they want, they may choose to sell their car in a different location , a different time, ect.We also trying to help the second car buyers to decide which kind of car worth to  buy and make the most of their money. 
In order to know how to sell a car or select  a used car in the market for a reasonable price, we build three analyzing models based on the used car database containing car attributes and its sales information crawled from eBay website  and dataset  form demographic database to find out different relationship patterns between 24 attributes and price. We also take “time to sell” as indicator of the rationality of the price. We use Gaussian Weighting Function to calculate analytical weight and add to  analyzing models.
